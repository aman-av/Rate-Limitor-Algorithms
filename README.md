Rate Limiter Algorithms
Rate limiting is a crucial technique in system design that helps control the rate at which requests are processed or served by a system. This approach prevents abuse, ensures system stability, provides fair resource allocation, and protects against various attacks like DDoS. Here's an overview of the most common rate limiting algorithms:

1. Token Bucket Algorithm
The Token Bucket algorithm uses tokens that represent permission to make requests:

How it works:

A bucket holds tokens that are added at a constant rate (the refill rate)
Each request consumes one or more tokens from the bucket
If the bucket is empty, requests are either rejected or delayed
The bucket has a maximum capacity, preventing token accumulation beyond a certain point
Advantages:

Allows for bursts of traffic (if tokens are available)
Provides granular control over request rates
Relatively simple to implement
Disadvantages:

Requires token management overhead
Memory usage increases with more users
Use cases: APIs with occasional burst needs, gaming applications

2. Leaky Bucket Algorithm
The Leaky Bucket algorithm processes requests at a constant rate:

How it works:

Requests enter a queue (the "bucket")
Requests are processed at a fixed rate (the "leak")
If the bucket fills up, new requests are rejected
The bucket has a maximum capacity
Advantages:

Smooths out traffic into a steady stream
Simple to implement
Provides consistent output rate
Disadvantages:

Cannot handle legitimate traffic bursts
May cause unnecessary delays
Use cases: Network traffic shaping, scenarios where consistent processing rate is required

3. Fixed Window Counter
The Fixed Window Counter algorithm divides time into fixed intervals:

How it works:

Time is divided into fixed windows (e.g., 1-minute intervals)
Each window has a counter that tracks requests
If the counter reaches the limit, additional requests are rejected
The counter resets at the start of each new window
Advantages:

Simple to understand and implement
Low memory requirements
Disadvantages:

Edge boundary problem: allows twice the rate limit across consecutive windows
May lead to resource spikes at window boundaries
Use cases: Simple rate limiting needs, scenarios with relaxed requirements

4. Sliding Window Log
The Sliding Window Log algorithm tracks the timestamp of each request:

How it works:

Stores a timestamp for each request in a time window
When a new request arrives, removes timestamps outside the current window
Counts remaining timestamps to check if the limit is reached
If count exceeds the limit, the request is rejected
Advantages:

Accurate rate limiting without boundary issues
Provides a true rolling window
Disadvantages:

Higher memory usage (stores all request timestamps)
Can be computationally expensive for high-traffic systems
Use cases: Scenarios requiring precise rate limiting

5. Sliding Window Counter
This is an optimized version of the Sliding Window Log:

How it works:

Combines elements of Fixed Window Counter and Sliding Window Log
Uses counters for fixed windows and calculates a weighted average for the current window
Provides a smoother transition between windows
Advantages:

More memory-efficient than Sliding Window Log
More accurate than Fixed Window Counter
Prevents traffic spikes at window boundaries
Disadvantages:

Slightly more complex to implement than other algorithms
Approximates the rate rather than being precisely accurate
Use cases: High-traffic systems requiring accurate rate limiting with memory efficiency

Implementation Considerations
When implementing rate limiters, consider:

Distributed systems: For distributed applications, ensure rate limiters work across multiple instances (using Redis, etc.)
Response handling: Provide informative responses when rate limits are exceeded (HTTP 429 status code)
Headers: Include rate limit information in response headers
Granularity: Choose appropriate rate limit windows based on your use case
User experience: Consider queueing vs. rejecting requests when limits are reached
Each algorithm has its strengths and optimal use cases, so the choice depends on your specific requirements for accuracy, memory usage, and traffic patterns.
